# https-node-demo

### More Information
This repo is intended to accompany my tutorial post over on [Medium](https://medium.com/@moores.alexd/setting-up-a-node-express-app-with-https-c36ca0537757)

### Getting Started
- Once you fork/clone the repo:
  - run `npm install` to get all your packages installed
  - edit line 13 in `server/app.js` to your domain

### Setting up your certificate and keys
- Install certbot
- Ensure you have port 443 open to the outside world
- Run Certbot
  - Give option 2 for the first prompt
  - Input your domain when prompted
  - Keep note of the location of your key/cert files
    - The default is the directory `/etc/letsencrypt/live/*_DOMAIN_*/`
    - If yours are in a location other than the default, you'll have to modify lines 15 and 16 in `server/app.js`

### Running the Server
- run `sudo node server/app.js` from the main project directory
  - You will need to run this as root because by default only root can read the key files, and only root can run processes on default ports like 80 and 443
  - Some linux servers will use the command `nodejs` instead of node
